\section*{Course Overview}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Structure of the course, Goals and Expectations
  \item Software Overview, Emory Resources
  \item Workflow and Reproducibility Overview
\end{itemize}

\section*{Structure of the course}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Technology Course: August 22nd, 23rd, 26th, 9:30AM-12:30PM
  \item R Course: Weekly starting Monday September 9th, 4:15-5:15PM
  \item Materials: Laptop, all software open source or available through Emory
  \item Goal: begin each session with review and instruction but majority of the session spent practicing and learning
\end{itemize}

\section*{Expectations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We understand the time constraints on everyone. The first year can be especially difficult as you are acclimating to graduate school and Emory University. No outside work is expected but we ask for the one hour a week of in-class time (and during the pre-class sessions) that you are present and participating.
  \item Class is ungraded but I will frequently ask you to turn in work to receive written feedback. This is to give you practice writing code for others to read and in presenting your results which are important skills for collaboration and sharing research. Additionally, we may engage in peer review by exchanging code with classmates.
\end{itemize}
