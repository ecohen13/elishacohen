abstract: For the three selection stages into the U.S. House-- candidate emergence, party nomination and winning the general -- we have years of research that evaluate each stage separately, with different data, different approaches and attempting to answer different questions. While this gives us a breadth of knowledge it limits our ability to compare the bias women are facing at each stage to understand where are the greatest leaks in the pipeline. Further, given incomplete attention to gender-party gaps during these stages we may be incorrectly averaging the experience across all women concealing that Democratic women and Republican women face different amounts of gender bias at different stages in the process. In order to better understand and compare the amount of gender bias Democratic and Republican women face in the process of getting elected to the U.S. House we need a single parameter that can be used at every selection stage. With an outcome test I am able to estimate the percentage of men who would not have been selected had they been women at all three stages in the process. Using Federal Elections Committee (FEC) data on campaign money raised, data from the Federal Assistance Awards Data System (FAADS) combined with data on primary and general elections I find that there is significant bias against women at every stage. While the candidate emergence stage remains a strong barrier in electing more women it is matched by significant but different within party bias in later stages. Democratic women in particular face a large amount of gender bias in the primaries while Republican women face the most bias in the general election..
