abstract: Outcome tests are a method comparing rates of observed outcomes across selected groups to evaluate bias in decision making processes. Building on the lower bound estimand from Knox, Lowe and Mummolo [2020], I derive a lower bound in terms of relative risks and develop a sensitivity analysis to weaken the selection-on-observables assumption. Additionally I develop a covariate adjusted sensitivity analysis to assess sensitivity to unmeasured covariates. I am able to estimate a bias adjusted outcome test robust to both measured and unmeasured confounders. Applying this outcome test and sensitivity analysis to data from the Chicago Police Department (1985-2016), I find evidence for gender bias in hiring. I estimate at least 7.4% of men would not have been hired had they been women.
