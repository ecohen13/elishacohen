abstract: Outcome tests are a method for detecting bias in selection procedures using data on selected units. The canonical example is the comparison of loan default rates between Black and White loan recipients, with lower Black default rates taken as evidence of bias against Black loan applicants (Becker (1971), Munnell et al. (1996)). We use a principal stratification approach to establish a lower bound on this bias (as in Knox, Lowe and Mummolo (2020)). We provide 1) a sharper lower bound when the outcome is non-binary and 2) a method for sensitivity analysis on this lower bound for violations of a selection-on-observables assumption. We illustrate these methods with a re-analysis of the data in Anzia and Berry (2011) on the delivery of federal spending by male and female members of congress. Using Anzia and Berry (2011) results, we find that 5.8\% of men elected, would not have been elected, had they been women.
