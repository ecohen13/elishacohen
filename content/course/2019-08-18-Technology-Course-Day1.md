Expectations
========================================================
incremental: true
- We understand the time constraints on everyone. The first year can be especially difficult as you are acclimating to graduate school and Emory University. No outside work is expected but we ask for the one hour a week of in-class time (and during the pre-class sessions) that you are present and participating.

- Class is ungraded but I will frequently ask you to turn in work to receive written feedback. This is to give you practice writing code for others to read and in presenting your results which are important skills for collaboration and sharing research. Additionally, we may engage in peer review by exchanging code with classmates.
