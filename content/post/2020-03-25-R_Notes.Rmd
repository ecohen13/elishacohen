## Matrices in R!

We can start by creating a 3X3 matrix and filling it with the numbers 1 to 9:

```{r c1}
A <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
```

If we use the `class()` function to check the class it should be of the matrix class:

```{r c2}
class(A)
```
This can be important because if matrix operations aren't working it may be that our object is a data.frame or tibble.
